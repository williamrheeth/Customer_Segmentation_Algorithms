# Customer_Segmentation_Algorithms

Implementing 2 different algorithms in Python for customer segmentation. Data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vetrirah/customer/data

- Algorithm A: Feature Engineering with Decision Tree -> Gaussian Mixture Model -> PCA to visualize
- Algorithm B: Frequent Pattern Mining -> Association Rule Mining -> Gaussian Mixture Model
Simple Multilayer Perceptron model was also implemented in the end of algorithm B.
